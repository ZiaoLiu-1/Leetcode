For beginners, I recommand doing question 70 first to help you develope a 
basic understanding of dynammic programming. The question is faily easy, 
almost identical to Fibonacci Number question. I encourage you to try the 
bottum up apporach to solve the questions. There will be more detailed 
description for the problems in the directory that help you understand and 
do the problem.
